# Dog-breed-identification-model

This model is built to identify the breed of a dog when given an image using TensorFlow.

The data we're using is from Kaggle's dog breed identification competition.

There are around 10,000+ images in the training and test set. These images have no labels because we'll want to predict them.

Turning the data into batches.

The 'mobilenet_v2' model from ImageNet is used.

Making and evaluating predictions using a trained model.

Preparing test dataset predictions for Kaggle."
